# Green Party (USA)

![Green_flag_waving.svg](/Green_flag_waving.svg)

I have decided to start following the Green Party after some research in the summer of 2021, as I discovered them through [stallman.org](https://stallman.org/) and I found it to be the perfect party for me. It shares all my current views, it just isn't very popular.

Some of the main views I share with it are:

* Pro-socialism, anti-capitalism

* Environmental protection

* Non-violence

* Social justice

* Experimenting with democracy

* Gender equality and LGBT+ rights

* Anti-war

* Anti-racism

Which is practically all the party stands for.

It is a left wing party. I am not joining the party or making donations, as I don't plan to be affiliated with them entirely. The democratic party never seemed to fit for me, but I will try to support them until the political environment isn't "one or the other" and I can't support the Republican party in any way, they have completely lost their minds, and they are stuck in a primitive, loony world that is as backwards as a medieval county in a barbaric primitive state.
