Political come out (Saturday, January 30th 2021)

I have been hiding my politics for a while. Seeing how many of the beliefs I have have been already made public, I have decided to come out further, as I don't want to be labeled incorrectly.

I am an independant that leans towards democratic socialism. I in no way lean conservative or to the Republican party. I have no plans in becoming a politician in office
I support socialism, but live in late-stage capitalism, and I hate many aspects of it.

I will keep my political beliefs inside of this repository and not let it spill out, unless absolutely necessary. If you see political bias in another one of my projects, please report it.

### Presidential ratings

Trump is the worst US president of ALL time as of 2021, beating out Andrew Jackson as the worst US president

Trump is a racist, sexist, paedophillic, stupid, evil monster

### Opinions

Most Republicans NEED to be deplatformed from Twitter, Facebook, etc.

The AR-15 and other semi-automatic and automatic firearms NEED TO BE BANNED from public usage. There is no ethical reason why you would need so many bullets other than to mass murder innocent people, which is not ethical at all. Hunting with an AR-15 would result in significant overkill on everything, and the weapon is too common in mass shootings, especially school shootings

The military needs to be defunded by at least $250,000,000,000.00 ($250B) and more money needs to go into Education

Politicians should have NO power in making/changing technical laws without having intermediate/advanced technical experience in what they are changing

School lunches should be free. It is extremely embarrassing that school lunch debt is a legitimate problem

Donald J Trump needs to be impeached and removed, even after he left office. His actions are not forgivable. He needs to be tried, convicted, stripped of his wealth, and spend the rest of his pathetic life in a maximum security federal prison.

The government really needs to upgrade any system they have that isn't 64 or 128 bit

The PRISM program, along with all other mass surveillance programs need to be abolished

Numbers shouldn't be illegal

Encryption should NOT be outlawed

Copyright needs to be abolished

Global warming is a real threat

Cancel culture is a bad thing in its current state. I feel like it is being used against the wrong people. It goes towards bad people most of the time, but not the even worse people.

China needs to be dealt with. Their government seems worse than the USSR. It is like full-on 1984 there.

***

Please use common sense. Don't gain prejudice and hate on people due to political beliefs. Avoid a "us vs. Them" situation. I plan on going no further with politics.
